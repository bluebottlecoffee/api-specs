  Common wrapper for API request/response objects.

  All PUT/POST/DELETE requests should come wrapped in an envelope with the
  request ID generated by the client. The source, and time of the request
  should also be generated client-side.

  By convention, prefer to use ULID as a request ID format.

  A response to a PUT/POST/DELETE request will return the same ID that was
  passed in on the request to correlate respones to a particular request.
  However, the `time` returned is the server side time of the response.

  For GET requests, the returned envelope ID will use the lambda context
  (or another server-side generated ID if the server is _not_ a lambda).
  The time will be the time of the response and the source will be gathered
  from the HTTP referer header.
